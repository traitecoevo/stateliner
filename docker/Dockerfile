# Fetch stateline dependencies; this is tricky, and based off of the
# set up in the stateline Dockerfile (by Lachlan).  Probably worth
# pinning the stateline against a release, but I think that NICTA tend
# to be very conservative about what makes it onto github.  We don't
# actually need most of the dependencies (checked with ldd) so we'll
# purge them after the bits of stateline we need have built.
